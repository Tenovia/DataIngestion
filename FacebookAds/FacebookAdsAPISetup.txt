This documentation covers the section for how different reports are
generated for FacebookAds.

1. From developers facebook account, create a new app.
   Get the app-id, the app-secret and generate an access token.
   NOTE: THE ACCESS TOKEN WILL EXPIRE IN TWO MONTHS. GENERATE A NEW ONE FROM THE DEVELOPER LINK.

   Saved these credentials in "tokenfb"

2.Download and install facebook-python-business-sdk
    pip3 install facebook_business

3.Create a text file "account_id" to store the id of the account to be externally accessed.
  For eg., for Paragon Facebook Ads we shall insert "act_165864193983217" into the "account_id" file.

4.In the python program,we use the account id to get all the campaign id's associated with that account.
  Set up my_account variable for a particular account and get all the campaign ids for the same.
    campaignids = my_account.get_campaigns()

5.Mentioned parameters for CAMPAIGN INSIGHTS reports.

7.Run it in a loop and extract campaign insights with the python lambda functions.


8.Process of creating the lambda function:
    Create a lambda function "FacebookAds_to_s3" using AWS Lambda services.
    Perform "sudo pip3 install --target ./packfb facebook_business" to install the contents of the module into a particular folder "packfb"
    Or just copy the contents of your already installed package into the folder you desire.
    Create a zip file of the contents of "packfb" and upload it to your lambda function.
    Create python functions for your code and a text file for "account_id" and another python file for "importtos3.py"
    Make sure the buckets and the path have already been created in S3.
    Push the data into folders in the S3 bucket using the lambda function.
