This program is used to Fetch the reports for basic filters present inside the Google Analytics, using Reporting API v4.

Click on the link for getting the documentation for how to register On Reporting API v4 to get the reports from Analytics
https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/quickstart/service-py

Instructions:
Step1:To fetch the reports, we firstly have to get the "HelloAnalytics.py" code from the google documentation. 

Step2:After getting the "HelloAnalytics.py" code, we need maintain "client_secrets.json" used in the python file, whose template can also be accessed using Analytics documentation.

Step3:Client_secrets.json contains type of service, project_id, private_key_id and private key.

Step4:These all required parameters can be accessed once you signup with a new account with client_email.

Step5:After Signin, Analytics console will provide one client_id, auth_uri, token_uri, auth_provider_x509_cert_url and client_x509_cert_url.

Step6:After clients_secrets.json required fields are completed press ctrl+s and close this file.

Step7:Now, to run HelloAnalytics.py program, we need to have some basic dependencies fulfilled.
	(i)  Python 2
	(ii) googleapiclient or apiclient package, which can be downloaded using pip.
	(iii)oauth2client python package(also accessible through pip).
	(iv) View_id of the project, whose reports you want to access.(ex:Paragon's View_id is:770*47*54)
	(v)  Client_secrets.json

Step8:In this step, we have to edit the "get_report()" function where we add different parameters as per our requirements.
	(i)  First, we need to specify date ranges in "dateRanges:" key, value pair.
	(ii) Then, in the next step, we need to add different metrics needed for accessing the detailed report.
		To get the detailed information about metrics and filters, please visit the link below.

	(iii)After specifying the metrics, we need to give the dimensions to the report, which can be considered as primary key of the report.
	(iv) In our case, we are accessing three basic reports in Analytics, which are report on the basis of country, city and language.
Step9:After doing all the steps, click ctrl+s and close the file.

Step10:type the python "HelloAnalytics.py" in terminal and that's it, report is here in front of you.


Reports:
Now, the question arises, what are these reports.

So, in the beginning, we do not have clear set of requirements, hence we are accessing only the basic reports, which can provide the maximum amount of data.
Given that, anyone noob in python language can also access the reports in the Analytics, by reading the Documentation written as above.
All you need to do is, change the metrics as per your requirements, specify the filter(dimension) of the report and we are all set to proceed.

CountryReports: In this report, you'll get the website data, divided on the basis of countries, where " number_of_users, users_sessions, bounce rate, revenue and many other important parameters are being fetched".
CityReports: City is included in the countryreport as a second dimension to exemplify, how multiple dimensions can be added to the report.
LanguageReport: Report, again based on Demographics, metrics just the same as countryreport, but on the basis of language.


All I need to Infer here is, you can change the dimensions, metrics, project(project_id) just by making few changes to the already running code.

All the best!!!
